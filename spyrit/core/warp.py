Stores deformation fields and warps images.

Contains :class:`DeformationField` and :class:`AffineDeformationField`, a
subclass of the former. These classes are used to warp images according to
a deformation field that is stored as as class attribute. They can be fed
an image (called "*original image*") and will return the warped image
("*deformed image*").

The function that maps the *original image* pixel coordinates to the *deformed
image* pixel coordinates is called the "*deformation field*" and is noted
:math:`v`. The function that maps the pixels of the *deformed image* to the
pixels of the *original image* is called the "*inverse deformation field*" and
is noted :math:`u`. The *deformation field* and the *inverse deformation field*
are related by the equation :math:`v = u^{-1}`.

Here, the two classes use and store the *inverse deformation field* :math:`u`
as a class attribute.

    r"""
    Stores a discrete deformation field as a :math:`(b,h,w,2)` tensor.

    Warps a single image according to an *inverse deformation field* :math:`u`,
    i.e. the field that maps the *deformed image* pixel coordinates to the
    *original image* pixel coordinates.

    It is constructed from a tensor of shape :math:`(n\_frames,h,w,2)`, where
    :math:`n\_frames` is the number of frames in the animation, :math:`h` and
    :math:`w` are the number of pixels along the height and width of the image respectively.
    The last dimension contains the x and y coordinates of the original image
    pixel that is displayed in the warped image.

    .. important::
        The coordinates are given in the range [-1;1]. When referring to a
        pixel, its position is the position of its center. The position
        [-1;-1] corresponds to the center of the top-left pixel.

    Args:
        :attr:`field` (torch.tensor):
        *Inverse deformation field* :math:`u` of shape :math:`(n\_frames,H,W,2)`,
        where :math:`n\_frames` is the number of frames in the animation, and
        :math:`H` and :math:`W` are the height and width of the image to be
        warped. For accuracy reasons, the dtype is converted to `torch.float64`.

    Attributes:
        :attr:`self.field` (torch.tensor):
        *Inverse deformation field* :math:`u` of shape :math:`(n\_frames,h,w,2)`.

        :attr:`self.n_frames` (int): Number of frames in the animation.

        :attr:`self.img_shape` (tuple): Shape of the image to be warped, i.e.
        :math:`(h,w)`, where :math:`h` and :math:`w` are the height and width
        of the image respectively.

        :attr:`img_h` (int): Height of the image to be warped in pixels.

        :attr:`img_w` (int): Width of the image to be warped in pixels.

        Warps a vectorized image or batch of vectorized images with the stored

        Deforms the vectorized image according to the *inverse deformation
        field* :math:`u` contained in the attribute :attr:`field`,
        sliced between the frames :math:`n0` (included) and :math:`n1` (excluded).
        :math:`u` is the field that maps the pixels of the *deformed image* to
        the pixels of the *original image*.

        This method assumes the vectorized image has the same number of pixels
        as the deformation field.

        Args:
            :attr:`img` (torch.tensor):
            The vectorized image to deform of shape :math:`(c, h*w)`, where
            :math:`c` is the number of channels
            (usually 1 or 3), and :math:`h` and :math:`w` are the number of
            pixels along the height and width of the image respectively.

            :attr:`n0` (int, optional):
            The index of the first frame to use in the *inverse deformation
            field*. Defaults to 0.

            :attr:`n1` (int, optional):
            The index of the first frame to exclude in the *inverse deformation
            field*. If None, the last available frame is used. Defaults to None.

            :attr:`mode` (str, optional):
            The interpolation mode to use. It is directly passed to the
            function :func:`torch.nn.functional.grid_sample`. It must be one of the
            following: 'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic'. Defaults to 'bilinear'.

        .. note::
            If :math:`n0 > n1`, :attr:`field` is sliced
            "backwards". The first frame of the warped animation corresponds to
            the index :math:`n0`, and the last frame corresponds to the index
            :math:`n1+1`. This behavior is identical to slicing a list with a
            step of -1.

            The deformed batch of images of shape :math:`(|n1-n0|,c,h,w)`, where each

    Stores an affine deformation field andn uses it to compute a discrete

    Warps an image or batch of images according to an *inverse affine deformation
    field* :math:`u`, i.e. the field that maps the *deformed image* pixel
    coordinates to the *original image* pixel coordinates.

    It is constructed from a function of one parameter (time) that returns a
    tensor of shape :math:`(3,3)` representing a 2D affine homogeneous transformation
    matrix. The homogeneous transformation matrix corresponds to the *inverse
    deformation field* :math:`u`, i.e. the field that maps the pixels of the
    *deformed image* to the pixels of the *original image*.

    To warp an image, the affine transformation matrix is evaluated at each
    time corresponding to the frames of the animation. The *inverse deformation
    field* :math:`u` is then computed from the inverse of the affine
    transformation matrix, and the image is warped according to the *inverse
    deformation field* :math:`u`.

    Contrary to :class:`DeformationField`, this class can warp images of
    variable sizes, as the *inverse deformation field* :math:`u` is computed from the
    affine transformation matrix at the desired spatial resolution.

        Function of one parameter (time) that returns a tensor of shape
        :math:`(3,3)` representing a 2D affine homogeneous transformation
        matrix, the *inverse deformation field* :math:`u`, i.e.
