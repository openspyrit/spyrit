Bonus. Advanced methods - Colab
===============================
.. _tuto_advanced_methods_colab:

We refer to `spyrit-examples/tutorial <https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit-examples/tree/master/tutorial>`_
for a list of tutorials that can be run directly in colab and present more advanced cases than the main spyrit tutorials,
such as comparison of methods for split measurements, or comparison of different denoising networks.
